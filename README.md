# delete-prereleases-for-branch

This action will retrieve the list of releases for the repository and delete any releases and associated tags that:

- Are marked as pre-release (it won't delete full releases)
- Include a pre-release branch tag in the format generated by [im-open/git-version-lite] (`major.minor.patch-<sanitized-branch-name>.<formated-date>`) in the release name or the release's tag.  
  - To sanitize the branch name, the characters `a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and -` are kept and any other character is replaced with `-`.  
- Are returned in the [list releases] API call. Depending on the permissions of the token it may return only published releases (not draft releases).

If the action runs into an issue deleting a specific release, it will generate a warning that can be viewed in the Summary section of the workflow rather than failing.  Errors retrieving the releases will still cause the action to fail though.

Small change to see if the for works.

    steps:
      - name: Clean up the releases that were created for this branch

```

## Contributing

When creating new PRs please ensure:

1. For major or minor changes, at least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
1. The action code does not contain sensitive information.

When a pull request is created and there are changes to code-specific files and folders, the build workflow will run and it will recompile the action and push a commit to the branch if the PR author has not done so. The usage examples in the README.md will also be updated with the next version if they have not been updated manually. The following files and folders contain action code and will trigger the automatic updates:

- action.yml
- package.json
- package-lock.json
- src/\*\*
- dist/\*\*

There may be some instances where the bot does not have permission to push changes back to the branch though so these steps should be done manually for those branches. See [Recompiling Manually](#recompiling-manually) and [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version) for more details.

### Recompiling Manually

If changes are made to the action's code in this repository, or its dependencies, the action can be re-compiled by running the following command:

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build

# Bundle the code (if dependencies are already installed)
npm run bundle
```

These commands utilize [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#bundling-for-node) to bundle the action and
its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.

### Incrementing the Version

Both the build and PR merge workflows will use the strategies below to determine what the next version will be.  If the build workflow was not able to automatically update the README.md action examples with the next version, the README.md should be updated manually as part of the PR using that calculated version.

This action uses [git-version-lite] to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.
| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |
