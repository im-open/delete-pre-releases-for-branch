# delete-prereleases-for-branch

This action will retrieve a list of releases for the repository and delete any releases and associated tags that:

- Are marked as pre-release.
  - This action will not delete regular releases.
- Are returned in the [list releases] API call.
  - Depending on the permissions of the token it may return only published releases (not draft releases).
- Have a release name or tag that follows [im-open/git-version-lite]'s format:
  - Format: `major.minor.patch-<sanitized-branch-name>.<formated-date>`
  - To sanitize the branch name, the characters `a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -` are kept and any other character is replaced with `-`.

If the action runs into an issue deleting a specific release, it will generate a warning that can be viewed in the Summary section of the workflow rather than failing the step.  Errors retrieving the releases will still cause the action to fail though.

## Contributing

When creating PRs, please review the following guidelines:

- [ ] The action code does not contain sensitive information.
- [ ] At least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version] for major and minor increments.
- [ ] The action has been recompiled.  See [Recompiling Manually] for details.
- [ ] The README.md has been updated with the latest version of the action.  See [Updating the README.md] for details.
- [ ] Any tests in the [build-and-review-pr] workflow are passing

### Incrementing the Version

This repo uses [git-version-lite] in its workflows to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge if [source code] changes have been made.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.

| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |

### Source Code Changes

The files and directories that are considered source code are listed in the `files-with-code` and `dirs-with-code` arguments in both the [build-and-review-pr] and [increment-version-on-merge] workflows.

If a PR contains source code changes, the README.md should be updated with the latest action version and the action should be recompiled.  The [build-and-review-pr] workflow will ensure these steps are performed when they are required.  The workflow will provide instructions for completing these steps if the PR Author does not initially complete them.

If a PR consists solely of non-source code changes like changes to the `README.md` or workflows under `./.github/workflows`, version updates and recompiles do not need to be performed.

### Recompiling Manually

This command utilizes [esbuild] to bundle the action and its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.  If changes are made to the action's [source code], the action must be recompiled by running the following command:

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build
```

### Updating the README.md

If changes are made to the action's [source code], the [usage examples] section of this file should be updated with the next version of the action.  Each instance of this action should be updated.  This helps users know what the latest tag is without having to navigate to the Tags page of the repository.  See [Incrementing the Version] for details on how to determine what the next version will be or consult the first workflow run for the PR which will also calculate the next version.

### Tests

The [build-and-review-pr] workflow includes tests which are linked to a status check. That status check needs to succeed before a PR is merged to the default branch.  When a PR comes from a branch, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has the necessary permissions required to run the tests successfully.

When a PR comes from a fork, the tests won't have the necessary permissions to run since the `GITHUB_TOKEN` only has `read` access for all scopes. When a PR comes from a fork, the changes should be reviewed, then merged into an intermediate branch by repository owners so tests can be run against the PR changes.  Once the tests have passed, changes can be merged into the default branch.
